### size_t
size_t is an unsigned integral data type which is defined in various header files such as: <stddef.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, < time .h>, <wchar.h> 
It's a type which is used to represent the size of objects 
in bytes and is therefore used as the return type by the sizeof operator.

### ssize_t
ssize_t is used for functions whose return value could either be a valid size, or a negative value to indicate an error. It is guaranteed to be able to store values at least in the range [-1, SSIZE_MAX] (SSIZE_MAX is system-dependent).

So you should use size_t whenever you mean to return a size in bytes, and ssize_t whenever you would return either a size in bytes or a (negative) error value. 

### \e[1;1H\e[2J (ANSI codes)
\e is escape and what that printf() line is telling the terminal to move the cursor to line 1 column 1 ( \e[1;1H ) and to move all the text currently in the terminal to the scrollback buffer ( \e[2J ). These are ANSI escape codes and here's some resources: https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797.

### (null)
In computer programming, null is both a value and a pointer. Null is a built-in constant that has a value of zero. It is the same as the character 0 used to terminate strings in C. Null can also be the value of a pointer, which is the same as zero unless the CPU supports a special bit pattern for a null pointer.
