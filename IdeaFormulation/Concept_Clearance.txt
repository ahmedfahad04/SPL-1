### size_t
size_t is an unsigned integral data type which is defined in various header files such as: <stddef.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, < time .h>, <wchar.h> 
It's a type which is used to represent the size of objects 
in bytes and is therefore used as the return type by the sizeof operator.

### ssize_t
ssize_t is used for functions whose return value could either be a valid size, or a negative value to indicate an error. It is guaranteed to be able to store values at least in the range [-1, SSIZE_MAX] (SSIZE_MAX is system-dependent).

So you should use size_t whenever you mean to return a size in bytes, and ssize_t whenever you would return either a size in bytes or a (negative) error value.
