## slsh:~# Simple Linux Shell
I will recreate a simple Linux Shell (Bash) that includes the basic shell operations namely:
 
* Executing simple shell commands (will implement a few of them due to time limitation)
* Command name customization (aliasing)
* Tentative command suggestion, 
* Text & background color customization
* Command auto-completion.
